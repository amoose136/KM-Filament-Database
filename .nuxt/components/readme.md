# Discovered Components

This is an auto-generated list of components discovered by [nuxt/components](https://github.com/nuxt/components).

You can directly use them in pages and other components without the need to import them.

**Tip:** If a component is conditionally rendered with `v-if` and is big, it is better to use `Lazy` or `lazy-` prefix to lazy load.

- `<FilamentImagePlaceholder>` | `<filament-image-placeholder>` (components/FilamentImagePlaceholder.vue)
- `<SmallHexTile>` | `<small-hex-tile>` (components/SmallHexTile.vue)
